explanation:

 
            1: mkdir Question10

           =>    Created folder for Question 9


            2:  cd Question10

           =>    move to folder Question10


            3: nano signal_demo.c

           => open nano editor 

            4:  gcc signal_demo.c -o signal_demo

           =>   This command compiles the C program and creates an executable named signal_demo.


            5:   ./signal_demo

           =>   The parent process starts running indefinitely while two child processes are created.

        After 5 seconds, the first child sends SIGTERM to the parent.
   The parent handles SIGTERM by printing a cleanup message.
        After 10 seconds, the second child sends SIGINT to the parent.
   The parent handles SIGINT differently and exits gracefully.
